                functionality. The same goes for upgrading to the Complete license. The upgrade fee is the price

                it comes in a couple of flavors
                for major Frameworks: Plain Javascript, jQuery and jQuery Mobile, Angular and Angular based frameworks
                (like Ionic) - both Angular JS and Angular 2+ is supported and React.</p>
